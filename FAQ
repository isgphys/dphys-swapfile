Frequently* Asked Questions (FAQ) for the dphys-swapfile project

* not really frequent, but that is what such files are called


Q: Why are you building an swap file script?

A: Because we want to get rid of the inflexibility of swap partitions


Q: Why not simply make an swap file by hand?

A: Because we want to dynamically resize fitting to RAM size, and also want
   automatic installation of our systems


Q: Why not simply mount from /etc/fstab?

A: Because we can not (re-)size/generate File until /var is mounted
   and need to do so before swapon, and at least under Debian can not
   insert our setup code in between them (both in same init script)


Q: Will this work on my $DISTRIBUTION

A: The actual script should work with any distribution. It auto-installs
   everything it needs. And can uninstall all of this, when called with
   "uninstall" as parameter. The Debian packaging is just for comfort


Q: Why is this called dphys-swapfile

A: Departement of PHYSics - SWAP FILE script


Q: Where can I get code?

A: The current (read: in edit, sometimes not functional) from:
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile/ or:
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile.tar.gz or

   Various milestones/releases (read: archives, working) from:
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile-<date>/ or:
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile-<date>.tar.gz
     where there are none at present, use the "current"

   Various package releases (read: archives, working) from:
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile_<date>-1.dsc
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile_<date>-1.tar.gz
   http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys-swapfile_<date>-1_all.deb
     where last milestone/release is <date>=20040611.145856
