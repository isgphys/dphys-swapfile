# this init.d script is intended to be run from rcS.d
#   must run after  mount  of  /var  which may only happen in  S35mountall.sh
#     for this reason we can not build swapfile until after  S35mountall.sh
#       so we also need to use  init.d start|stop  to swapon|off our file
#   and sensibly before the lots of stuff which may happen in  S40networking
#     and may want to use a lot of memory, and so requires swap to be running
#   so we run it as rcS.d/S37dphys-config

# get ready to work
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
export PATH

# what we are
NAME=dphys-swapfile
PNAME=dphys-swapfile
