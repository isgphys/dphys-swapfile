background is the dphys2 project, read its Logfile at:
  http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin/Projects/dphys2/Logfile
as part of that wrote this tool to auto-generate/us an swapfile
  here only log of the events pertaining to making this tool

2003.01.09 Thu
dphys2 milestone 1 is reached, make archive copy to ../dphys2-20021218

2003.04.17 Thu
dphys2 milestone 2 is reached, make archive copy to ../dphys2-20030417

2003.08.04 Mon
dphys2 milestone 3 is reached, make archive copy to ../dphys2-20030804

2003.08.14 Thu
setup-dphys2, dbootstrap, INSTALL added option for no swap partition
  only make option for partition/none, for file set to none and add later
    so simply set ${CONF_SWAP_SIZE} to 0 or comment out its definition
  also avoids trouble if user gives 0 and system tries to mkswap/use it
all mounting seems to be in /etc/rcS.d, check when swap need to be up
  before S35mountall.sh the swap file needs be be ready
  but also used in S10checkroot.sh, for while fsck, and that before writable

2003.08.15 Fri
make package dphys-swapfile to set up and later resize existing swap file
  run between rcS.d 30 (fsck, /var ready) and 35 (mount, uses swapfile)
  making 1G takes 25s and mkswap 5s, so not every time, just when resize
    compute new size, compare with old, if diff remove and make new
  if config file do that size, else 2*RAM, usually about 1G
    looking at host berlin, only 1.9G free from 10G disk, is 1.8G apt cache
      add an apt-get clean to dphys-admin, as unlikely to reinstall, have LAN
  decided to auto-select 2*RAM, unless user config /etc/default/dpyhs-swapfile
    also limit to max 2G kernel limit
  script is an init.d, will start on reboot, also run once on pkg install
  added --purge to drop swapfile from fstab, swapoff, rm
packaged version 20030815.175513-1, changelog:
  "auto-generated release from versionless (=current) upstream"

2003.10.03 Fri
convert existing binary packages to using makesourcepackage
  dsbg leave old hosts arizona,bludger,dudley (will be deleted later)
    do as last with him site (he is actively working on it)
  every package that is converted and on server, remove from CVS
  do all other dphys-build/*/DEBIAN: admin, host-hagrid, ide-dma, reboot,
    site-franklin-experimental, swapfile, user-info

2003.10.31 Fri
setup-dphys2 default swap off (for using use dphys-swap or similar)
dphys2-swap worked over dphys-swap, /etc/rcS.d script
  S32 is too early, /var may not be mounted (only in S35), use S37
  S37 after swapon in S35, so need own swapo[n|ff], no line in fstab, comment

2003.11.06 Thu
further with converting dphys-swap to dphys2-swap, make upstream Makefile
  move over existing changelog (uncompressed and renamed) to start new one
  move over existing conffiles, fix packagename in /e/i.d/<packagename>
    extend makesourcepackage to insert conffiles into package
      also more than just README upstream doc, improve commenting dh_* sections
      also to conffiles and postinst|prerm add also preinst and postrm
      also install init.d script from debian/init.d, not in upstream Makefile
  postinst angepasst, kein swapon, da  init.d start  das schon macht
  prerm macht eh nix, standard nehmen
  postrm muss nicht mehr benutztes swapfile loeschen
    kann nicht  /e/i.d/d2-s purge  benutzen weil das bereits geloescht ist

2003.11.07 Fri
dphys2-swap init.d makesourcepackage  to modify/generate postinst and postrm
  makesourcepackage rules file call to execute this section
dphys2-swap upload to package server, apt-get update and install, OK
  stop and start, OK, remove and install, OK, purge and install, OK
packaged version 20031107.173603-1, changelog:
  "ported to makesourcepackage, fixed runlevel"

2003.11.13 Thu
deleted old dphys-swapfile package from server, only in use on my home machines
index.html rename dphys-swap to dphys2-swap and link .tar|.dsc|.tar.gz files
  doku remarks that PXE net boot is possible (user failled to notice it)
  added remark that makepackage is deprecated, use makesourcepackage
dphys2 root disk option to autoinstall dphys2-swap package
  setup-dphys2 option,  makeroot copy into root image
  dbootstrap copy into target system and install base-config script
    dropped use of SWAP_TYPE variable, directly use CONF_SWAP_SIZE
  base-config script install package using  dpkg --install
    for this endfirstrun SYS_BASECONF_DIR in setup-dphys2, for dbootstrap also
      same with DEBUG_LEAVE_SCRIPTS, renamed to DEBUG_LEAVE_BC_SCRIPTS
    enfirstrun eliminate last CONF_* variable, direct in code, simpler

2003.11.14 Fri
dphys2 autoinstall dphys2-swap package finished additions

2003.11.20 Thu
dphys2-swapfile fixed init.d script bug, missing output redirect to /dev/null
dphys2-swapfile added an example config file in /etc/default/dphys2-swapfile
  extended makesourcepackage to install such an config if existant
  testing noticed init.d start when already running gives swapon error
    same on init.d stop if not still running, or on deconfig, correct this
  changes to use variable names CONF_SWAPFILE and CONF_SWAPSIZE
CVS deleted old dphys-swapfile stuff, package also gone, and no use any more
setup-dphys2 option dphys2-swapfile tidy up code in dbootstrap
  put entire part that works in /target in subshell ( chroot /target ... )

2003.11.27 Thu
dphys2-swapfile still messes up output, with "Adding Swap: ... (priority -1)"
  between the  keeping it  and  , done.  outputs from init.d script
  test swapoff/swapon has no such output, but it appears on the console
    is kernel -> klogd -> syslogd which is doing this, no option, leave it

2003.12.04 Thu
swapfile syslog output cannot be prevented, so finish our line before syslog
packaged version 20031204.141601-1, changelog:
  "no makesourcepackage stuff in init.d, separate script"

2004.02.19 Thu
dphys2 release 4th milestone, copy to ../dphys2-20040219, make tar file of it

2004.05.14 Fri
convert dphys2-swapfile to new dh_* based makesourcepackage
  updated Makefile preset variables, debian/control added Build debhelper
  rm debian/conffiles (was auto-generated anyway)
  mv default dphys2-swapfile.default, changed it to normal hand edited, not gen
  mv init.d dphys2-swapfile.init, removed automatic modifications, hand edited
  rm debian/postinst (will be generated), prerm (same)
  postrm changed to include #DEBHELPER#, and only mod fstab and del swapfile
    CONF_SWAPFILE as variable, even if set only here, not by /etc/default/*
    renamed to debian/<packagename>.postrm, man dh_installdb incomprehensible
  generated new style debian/rules file, so ready to package

2004.05.27 Thu
dphys2-swapfile heeb file should not be 644, can have root processes in it
  added an chmod 600 to start), while at it uninstall) in init.d script
  init.d script, default, postrm comments updated, made package and uploaded it
packaged version 20040527.143106-1, changelog:
  "change to using dh_* based source package"

2004.05.28 Fri
dphys2-swapfile separate project, as only replacing swappartit, not installing
  rename it into dphys-swapfile, no 2 as not part of dphys2 any more
made FAQ, INSTALL, (this) Logfile, Makefile add tar stuff, new own README
  debian dir, rename files and names in them
  index.html.en, linked from projects and startup page
  make tar, generating standard .tar.gz file
packaged, (re-)generating .dsc, debianised .tar.gz and .deb files
  no new makesourcepackage -l  yet, as release most likely next week
  index.html.en link to also to the package stuff, still old number
    dito also in FAQ and INSTALL remarks which is newest package version

2004.06.03 Thu
renaming makes this package replace old name package
  heeb policy discussion, no Conflicts:/Provides:/Replaces: in control
    simply  - dphys2-swapfile  + dphys-swapfile in main-pkglist
    worst case if no swapoff possible 2nd nameless swap remains until reboot
init script added full paths to all programs, so path/pwd independant
split init script, most in main dir (/sbin/), only call in debian (/etc/init.d)
  updated Makefile to package it, and index.html.en to show this
  also Makefile code to install it, independant from Debian part
delete swapfile moved from postrm to prerm, when script and config still exists
  so it can use /sbin script (with uninstall), and config stuff used by that
  user who removes and reinstalls package will have to regenerate swapfile
    config as such is not lost, and that is then auto-deleted when purge

2004.06.04 Fri
wrote man page for /sbin Script, added to Makefile
in swapon and uninstall added test for file, in swapon error if not present
improved docs with better description of reason for own swapon/off
added  makesourcepackage -l  with descriptions, change all references
CVS remove dphys-admin, commit, update, this time it really is gone
packaged version 20040604.142815-1, changelog:
  "separate project, renamed, separate action/init, delete in prerm"

2004.06.11 Fri

2004.07.29 Thu
improved docs, INSTALL show what steps need to be done, i.e. are important
created debian/dphys-swapfile.docs, with README, FAQ, index.html.en
release 5th milestone, copy to ../dphys-swapfile-20040729, make tar file of it
  modifed index.html and FAQ and INSTALL to show the milestone release
  redo ../dphys-swapfile.tar.gz tar archive of current state
packaged version 20040729.164251-1, changelog:

man pages expand explanation, added examples of use section
  showing typical usage, including an minimal example init.d script
change copyright remarks to mention modified/non-advertising BSD
packaged version 20040827.135743-1, changelog:
  "expanded man page"

2005.04.21 Thu
checked up that this package has no woody dependencies, will run under sarge
  not really surprising, as it also runs OK on my personal slackware systems
  as no needed changes, leave the slight problem with /etc/default unchanged
  imported this package into local sarge package server

2006.08.11 Fri
added all "packaged version ????????.??????-?, changelog:" lines

2006.09.15 Fri
get ready for publication as an official Debian Linux ?.? (etch) package
  all actions here analog to everything done in dphys-config
  reworked and updated documentation, FAQ, INSTALL, README, index.html.en
  senguen wanst to make own debian/* as lintian complains about native package
    looked into any information lost if deleting debian/* to avoid collision
  debian/changelog is all info duplicated in this Logfile, deleted it
  debian/control is just docu text, add to other docs, README and index.html.en
  debian/copyright is nearly same as in README, updated that
  debian/dphys-swapfile.default moved to dphys-swapfile.example
    changed code and man page to reflect no /etc/default/* any more
    will also install into /usr/share/doc/examples and not /etc/default
      was already on "todo" since 2005.04.21 entry up above
  debian/dphys-swapfile.docs is nothing, deleted it
  debian/dphys-swapfile.init is simple example, move to main dir
    add to Makefile installation into examples directory
  debian/dphys-swapfile.prerm notified senguen what he needs to do, deleted it
  debian/rules has nothing specific, deleted it
  as only producing an "upstream" and senguen doing "maintainer" version
    remove FAQ and INSTALL and index.html.en references to my old packages
bug source check possibility of  cut -f 2-  or similar where no delimitors
bug source check  echo "${blah}"  against possible  *  or similar ${blah} data
better bug discovery addition  set -e
changed code to read in config file only once, no after computation overwrite
released 6th (and 2nd feature completed, just repackaged and fixes) milestone
  modified index.html and FAQ and INSTALL to show the milestone release
  no Debian packaging any more, senguen does this now, no changelog entry
  copy to ../dphys-swapfile-20060915, made tar file of that
  remade ../dphys-swapfile.tar.gz archive for current state

2006.10.13 Fri
do all changes done since then to dphys-config, get up to same code standard
  PATH= revised, removed absolute paths in commands
    no /usr/local stuff, as no FreeBSD port intended, too Linux specific
    Makefile dphys-swapfile init.d.example
  check possibly problematic code features
    echo -e  replaced by normal  echo,  no \? in it anyway
    no ./<commandname> config script called, cut -f only 1 harmless one
    "" quoting updated in dphys-swapfile init.d.example
    no ~ used anywhere, as is not user software
    no shell functions, so no keyword function to remove
  remade ../dphys-swapfile.tar.gz archive

2006.10.20 Fri
analog to dphys-config also run automatic quoting check
  added all missing, even in places where it can never fail, so check quiet
  remade ../dphys-swapfile.tar.gz archive
after all bugfixes and changes new release
  updated FAQ, INSTALL, README, index.html.en
  copy to ../dphys-swapfile-20061020, made tar file of that
  remade ../dphys-swapfile.tar.gz archive for current state
