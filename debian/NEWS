dphys-swapfile (20061020-3) unstable; urgency=low

  dphys-swapfile now also recognizes CONF_MAXSWAP and CONF_SWAPFACTOR in
  /etc/dphys-swapfile. See dphys-swapfile(8) for details.
  
  The old undocumented variables MAXSWAP and SWAPFACTOR do not work
  anymore and have been replaced by the variables mentioned above.
