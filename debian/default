# where we want the swapfile to be, this is the default
#CONF_SWAPFILE=/var/swap

# size we want to force it to be, default (empty) gives 2*RAM
#CONF_SWAPSIZE=

# maximum size of the swap file in MBytes
#CONF_MAXSWAP=2048

# the relation between RAM and swap size (must be an integer), defaults to 2,
# which means the swap file will be 2 times the size of the RAM
#CONF_SWAPFACTOR=2
