Introduction to dphys-swapfile setup/mount script


Aim

This program is aimed at using an automatically (re-)sized swapfile instead
of an fixed size (from partitioning) swap partition


Preconditions

This program should work on any Linux system.


Tools

This project has produced an init script for (re-)creating an swap file on
every boot, and then mounting it, also unmounting it on shutdown, and offering
removal of the swap file when not needed any longer.


Code

This project is fully open source. Documentation gets written together with the
code. Everything I write is immediately available for download. Current version
is what I am working on, if I write a bug you crash the next day. Older stable
versions are archived as Milestones.


State

Working package, in productive use on over 100 machines.
